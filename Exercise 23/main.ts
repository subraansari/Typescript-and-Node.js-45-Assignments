//          Question 23
// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//  let car = 'subaru';
//  console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//  console.log(car == 'subaru')
//  • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//  • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.


let five = 5;
let ten = 10;

//Test 1
console.log("Test 1: Five is equal to 5");
console.log(five == 5);

//Test 2
console.log("Test 2: Ten is equal to 10");
console.log(ten == 10);

//Test 3
console.log("Test 3: Five is not equal to 10");
console.log(five !== 10);

//Test 4
console.log("Test 4: Ten is greater than 5");
console.log(ten > 5);

//Test 5
console.log("Test 5: Five is Less than 10");
console.log(five < 10);

//Test 6
console.log("Test 6: Ten is Less than 5");
console.log(ten < 5);

//Test 7
console.log("Test 7: Five is equal to 10");
console.log(five == 10);

//Test 8
console.log("Test 8: Ten is not equal to 10");
console.log(ten !== 10);

//Test 9
console.log("Test 9: Five is greater than 10");
console.log(five > ten);

//Test 10
console.log("Test 10: Five is not equal to 5");
console.log(five !== 5);
