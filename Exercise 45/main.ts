//      Question 45
//Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly

function create_car(manufacturer, model , ...options){
    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    }
    options.forEach(options => {
        let [key , value] = options.split(":")
        car [key.trim()] = value.trim()
    })
    return car;
}

let my_car = create_car("Toyota" , "Corolla" , "Color : Black" , "Sunroof : true")
console.log(my_car);
